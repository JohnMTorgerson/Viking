Issues which will need to be addressed in the future.

 === Stopgap Measures ===
 These are shortcuts we have taken to speed up development which result in precarious code, the parents of future bugs.

 These are things which are unlikely to break anything when absent, but will result in a smarter bot.

 - findBestSingleTakeoverPath() should pick the path with the most armies on the starting country if all else is equal

 - create a land-grab objective

 - smart borders for takeover objective areas

 - fortifying

 - pick countries
