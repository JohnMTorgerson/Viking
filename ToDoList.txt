Issues which will need to be addressed in the future.

 === Stopgap Measures ===
 These are shortcuts we have taken to speed up development which result in precarious code, the parents of future bugs.
 
  - We are making use of BoardHelper.cheapeastRouteFromOwnerToCont in getCheapestRouteToArea, even though it is restricted to continents, and thus if the bot decides to take over a non-continent area, an approach we support in other areas, it will fail.
  
 === Missing Features === 
 These are things which are unlikely to break anything when absent, but will result in a smarter bot.

 - handle forking when finding paths
 - handle islands when finding paths
