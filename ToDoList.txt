Issues which will need to be addressed in the future.

 === Stopgap Measures ===
 These are shortcuts we have taken to speed up development which result in precarious code, the parents of future bugs.
 
  - We haven’t tested any maps with one-way connections

  - We haven’t tested any maps with negative continent bonuses
  
 === Missing Features === 
 These are things which are unlikely to break anything when absent, but will result in a smarter bot.

 - fortifying

 - pick countries

 - add a way for the bot to take over the whole map at once when it has enough armies to do it in a single turn

 - card smarts: create objective to eliminate a player to get their cards;
                anything else for card smarts?
